The staff has to select Login or Close App from the welcome options variable. If the staff selects login, he has to enter one of the usernames and passwords provided for in the staff.txt file, if not the staff's input will be invalid and they will need to try again until they provide the correct details.When the user logs in,a usersessions.txt file is automatically created and stores the users session.
After entering the correct details, the staff has to choose whether they want to create a new acccount, check account details or logout. If the staff selects create a new account, they have to enter in the details of this new account and an account number is generated for the customer.

If the customer then choses to logout, his or her users session is automatically deleted and they are returned back to the Login page.The program exits when the user/staff chooses to close app.
